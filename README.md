CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India.

Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents.a marketing data analyst is tasked to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.

Here are my 5 recomendation for CODEX

**What immediate improvements can we bring to the product?**
As per our survey analysis, most peopler prefer more natural ingredients as well rudece the sugar content. Other then that we need to more focus on avalability of energy drink. Most people purchasing energy drink from supermarkets. so, we need to focus on that.

**What should be the ideal price of our product?**
People prefring the price range of 50-99, but some of the cities where people also go for price range 100-150 also.

**What kind of marketing campaigns, offers, and discounts we can run?**
Young people influenced by the online ads. People who consume most energy drinks are young and adults. They are highly social media users. Online ads. are also cheaper then other marketing channels, so we should focus more on online ads. we can also make creative packaging to attract consumers.

**Who can be a brand ambassador, and why?**
With 253+ million Instagram followers, Virat Kohli has immense influence over the youth, making him an ideal ambassador for our product.
Virat Kohli is widely recognized for his exceptional mental and physical strength, which sets him apart as a remarkable role model for the youth.
